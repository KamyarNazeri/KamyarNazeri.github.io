                <font size="2">1-Efficient numerical methodologies aimed at Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) of the breast</font>
            </h3>
            <font size="2">
                Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease among Canadian women. Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
                frequently performed prior to breast conserving surgery in order to assess the location and extent of the lesion.
                Ideally, the surgeon should be able to use the pre-surgery image information during surgery to guide the excision.
                This requires the prone pre-surgical MR image to be aligned or co-registered to conform to the patient's supine position
                on the operating table. The registration step can be modelled as an inverse problem that is ill-posed, i.e., has
                no unique solution.<br>
                <br> Recently, we have developed a computationally efficient registration scheme based on Thin-Plate-Splines to align
                pre-surgical images to the operating room position using MR-visible surface markers placed before imaging. While
                the results are promising, the next natural step is to eliminate the requirement of placing the surface markers in
                the registration scheme. The future breast CAS technology will demand novel efficient hybrid surface-intensity based
                registration algorithms that employ the surface information of the operating room along with the intensity information
                of the pre-surgical images. The highly deformable nature of the breast tissue is one of the main challenges of solving
                this ill-posed inverse problem.<br>

            <font size="2">
                DCE imaging has emerged as a powerful screening tool for identifying carcinoma in high-risk populations. Accurate registration
                of DCE images is valuable for proper identification of the lesions. Recently, we have developed a simple coupled
                PDE approach to joint registration and intensity correction of the DCE images. In general, the contrast uptake curves
                are results of a physical process. Motion correction of images coupled with this process is a significant step in
                identification of malignancies. This requires defining regularization expressions that directly incorporate the underlying
                physical process of this inverse problem.<br>

            </h3>
            <font size="2">
                In image registration, researchers generally rely on transformations to describe the alignment process relating two
                images. However, in the clinical setting, there are many situations where the “true” deformation may have discontinuities.
                For example, one would expect the transformation between the images of a patient before and after tumor resection
                would contain a singularity or a hole. Previously, the problems of rips/tears have been addressed using the Total
                Variation (TV) regularization, but this typically only works well for extremely small discontinuities. Furthermore,
                these approaches do not at all address the clinical problems where singularities or holes are present in the true
                deformation. Given these limitations of current approaches to image registration, an open problem is to define an
                approach that would enable deformable registration in the presence of various types of large-scale discontinuities.
                One potential approach is to develop a registration technique that implicitly allows topological changes in the deformation
                field, much like the use of level sets in image segmentation allows implicitly for topological changes in region
                boundaries.
